3. In the Northern Hemisphere, around the time of the summer solstice (around **June 21st**)), the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky. In the Southern Hemisphere, this occurs around the time of the winter solstice (around **December 21st**).
    
4. In the Northern Hemisphere, during the winter months, the Sun is lower in the sky, and solar noon occurs at a lower angle.
