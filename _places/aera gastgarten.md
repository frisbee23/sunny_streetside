east side of the garden (really just tables on the street) has sun until 11:45 in summer.

the aera building is 30m high, and the main sunblocker until 15h;
then it's the opposite side of werdertorgasse, which are 34m high.

west side has sun from 15:00, but only for about an hour. (more data needed)
